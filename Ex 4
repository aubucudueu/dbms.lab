4. a. Query the Database Using Subqueries and Joins
Using Subqueries:
SELECT * FROM Employee WHERE Salary > (SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM Employee);
SELECT * FROM Employee WHERE ManagerId IS NOT NULL;
SELECT * FROM Employee WHERE EmployeeId NOT IN (SELECT PersonId FROM Address);
Using Simple Joins:
SELECT e.EmployeeId, e.Name, e.Salary, a.City, a.State FROM Employee e
LEFT JOIN Address a ON e.EmployeeId = a.PersonId;
SELECT e.Name AS EmployeeName, m.Name AS ManagerName FROM Employee eINNER JOIN Employee m ON e.ManagerId = m.EmployeeId;
4. b. Find Duplicate Emails
If the Email column exists in the Employee table:
SELECT Email, COUNT(*) AS Count FROM Employee GROUP BY Email HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
4. c. Add a Column to the Person Table
ALTER TABLE Person ADD Age INT;
4. d. Rename the Person Table to Employee
ALTER TABLE Person RENAME TO Employee;
4. e. Drop the Person Table
DROP TABLE Person;
