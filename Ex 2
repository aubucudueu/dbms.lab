2. a. Create Tables with Foreign Key Constraints and Referential Integrity
Hereâ€™s an example of setting up a database schema for employees and managers:
Create the Tables:
CREATE TABLE Employee (EmployeeId INT PRIMARY KEY, Name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,ManagerId INT,Salary DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL FOREIGN KEY (ManagerId) REFERENCES Employee(EmployeeId));
Insert Data into the Tables:
INSERT INTO Employee (EmployeeId, Name, ManagerId, Salary)
VALUES 
    (1, 'Alice', NULL, 90000.00),
    (2, 'Bob', 1, 60000.00),
    (3, 'Charlie', 1, 70000.00),  
    (4, 'David', 2, 65000.00),    
    (5, 'Eve', 3, 80000.00);      
2. b. Find Employees Who Earn More Than Their Managers
SELECT e.Name AS EmployeeName, m.Name AS ManagerName, e.Salary AS EmployeeSalary, m.Salary AS ManagerSalary FROM Employee e JOIN Employee m ON e.ManagerId = m.EmployeeId WHERE e.Salary > m.Salary;
