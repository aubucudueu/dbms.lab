5. a. Query Database Tables Using Subqueries and Joins
Find Customers with Orders:
SELECT * FROM Customer WHERE CustomerId IN (SELECT CustomerId FROM Orders);
Find Customers Without Orders:
SELECT * FROM Customer WHERE CustomerId NOT IN (SELECT CustomerId FROM Orders);
Using Joins:
Inner Join to Show Customer Orders:
SELECT c.CustomerId, c.Name, o.OrderId, o.OrderDate FROM Customer c INNER JOIN Orders o ON c.CustomerId = o.CustomerId;
Left Join to Include Customers Without Orders:
SELECT c.CustomerId, c.Name, o.OrderId FROM Customer c LEFT JOIN Orders o ON c.CustomerId = o.CustomerId;
5. b. Find All Customers Who Never Ordered Anything
To find customers with no orders using a LEFT JOIN:
SELECT c.CustomerId, c.Name FROM Customer c LEFT JOIN Orders o ON c.CustomerId = o.CustomerId WHERE o.OrderId IS NULL;
Alternatively, using a subquery:
SELECT CustomerId, Name FROM Customer WHERE CustomerId NOT IN (SELECT CustomerId FROM Orders);
5. c. Count the Total Number of Orders Placed by All Customers
SELECT COUNT(*) AS TotalOrders FROM Orders;
5. d. Count the Number of Customers Who Have Placed At Least One Order
Using a COUNT DISTINCT:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT CustomerId) AS CustomersWithOrders FROM Orders;
Alternatively, using a JOIN:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT c.CustomerId) AS CustomersWithOrders FROM Customer c
INNER JOIN Orders o ON c.CustomerId = o.CustomerId;
